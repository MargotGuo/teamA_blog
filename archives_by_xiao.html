        <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
        <p class="event-text">
          We learnt basic knowledge of HTML.
          HTML was used to build our teamA blog webpage. We allocated tasks using Trello, which is frequently-used tool for developers.
          We finished three task cards and built the structure of the webpage. Then we did code review and Xin helped us to go through the code. 
          We really appreciate his help.
