      JR Alli said: "At the beginning of the year I spent a week exploring the amazing city of London. 
      I was captivated by the intricacy and beauty and wanted to try and replicate the hustle and bustle, 
      the various moving parts of what makes London so unique and great."

      JR Alli said: "I had to re-upload this video because I was accused of stealing a clip (lasted only 1 second in the video).
      The owner did not want to talk about working it out and attacked me on all my social medias filing a complaint with YouTube giving me a copyright strike and taking the video down. 
      It's an unfortunate situation, but if you've already watched it, 
      please show it some love again and click the like button. 
      I'm working on a vlog that should be rolling out in a few weeks and a video for Toronto. 
      Thanks for all the love and support."
